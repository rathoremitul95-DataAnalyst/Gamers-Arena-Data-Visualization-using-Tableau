# Objective
As an analytics lead, you must design an interactive dashboard that helps the director of the company make a decision on a new sales model (a subscription model) that will attract more gamers to our platform. There are multiple questions to be answered in order to make the decision on the subscription model.

There are multiple questions to be answered in order to make the decision on the subscription model. For example, which games need to be given for the subscription and what would be the duration? In order to answer these questions, a dashboard needs to be created with the following information:

What is the total number of games? What is the total global sales in millions of dollars (USD)?What is the average CriticScore? What is the total number of users?
Which are the top-N games, top-N platforms, and top-N genres based upon GlobalSales?
How have GlobalSales been distributed across platforms and genres?
Which are the top-N games based upon UserScore, CriticScore, and the number of users rated?
What are the top N games based on the number of users rated and what is the average UserScore for these games?

# Business Context
Gamers' Arena is a website that provides information about video games. It keeps track of the games that have been released and their sales across various platforms and genres. Different genres, such as RPGs, shooters, multiplayer, action, and so on, would appeal to different audiences. Gamers' Arena has now implemented a feature on their website that allows gamers to subscribe to their platform on a month-to-month basis. They can play a limited number of games as long as they have a subscription.

# Data Description
The dataset contains information related to the games, their release year, platform, genre and their sales. Each row represents a Unique Game and the Platform for which it is released, Sales(in million $), UserScore, CriticScore etc.. You can find the data video_games.xlsx in the module & the dictionary attached as well -video_games_dictionary.pdf.

# Note:
For each KPI, you should create a separate sheet. No chart is required for KPIs in Q1
For Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5, create a separate sheet as per the required columns.
You should create only one dashboard for the problem statement by combining the sheets created for all questions. Multiple dashboards are not required.
You can use Objects in the Dashboard for the title and KPIs if required.
You should not use chart as floating type in the dashboard to avoid clutter.
You should use fixed size Generic Dashboard(1366px*768px) to avoid the inconsistency of the device used.
Solution Approach
A sample template and hints are provided in the Tableau Project - Business Context & Solution Approach.pdf, you may use this as a guide to do your project. Nevertheless, this is "just a template", you can get creative, explore the data and provide additional insights as well over and above answering the required business questions for the evaluation!
